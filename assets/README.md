# GFUNK's Prework Study Guide

## Description

Prework Study Guide that explains HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript notes for reference for future projects.  It is designed to help me get familiar with these terms as I start the UCLA extension coding boot camp. The more I have used these reference notes, the more comfortable I am becoming.
