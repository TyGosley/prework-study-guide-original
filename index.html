        <h2>HTML</h2>

        <ul>

            <li>The head element contains information about the webpage</li>

            <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>

            <li>Used to create the structure of a webpage.</li>

            <li>It is made up of elements which work together to provide content and the basic framework for all pages on the web.</li>

            <li>An element is a type of content on the webpage.</li>

            <h3>Commonly used elements are</h3>

            <li>Text elements</li>

            <li>Image elements</li>

            <li>Header elements</li>

            <li>List elements</li>

            <h3>Common element types</h3>

            <li>Elements are also used to divide the content on the page to describe the content to browsers and other developers</li>

            <li>Some common element types used to divide and describe a page</li>

            <li>Meta-related elements</li>

            <li>Content division elements</li>

            <li>Semantic elements</li>

            <h3>Head and Body elements</h3>

            <li>Two elements are important to understanding how the structure works. The head and body element</li>

            <li>The Head element contains information (metadata) that helps browser to render the page correctly</li>

            <li>The Body element contains the content that is shown to the user</li>

            <h3>Metadata tags</h3>

            <li>title element defines the webpage. This element is extremely important for SEO</li>

            <li>style element defines the CSS styles</li>

            <li>base element defines the the base URL for webpage</li>

            <li>link element connects an external resource to the HTML document</li>

            <li>meta element defines metadata such as character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport</li>

            <li>script element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document</li>

            <h3>Nerd Notes</h3>

            <li>Elements nested inside other elements are called child elements.  The element that holds all the children is the parent element</li>

            <li>element and tag are used interchangeably in the web development world, but there is a difference. An element refers to the entire element from opening to colsing tag, whereas a tag refers to what appears inside the angle brackets.</li>

            <li>Headers: (h1) to (h6) represent level of heading.</li>

            <li> The (ul), (ol), and (li) elements represent unordered list, ordered lists, and list items. Basically represented as bulleted or numbered lists.</li>

            <li> footer element appears at the bottom of the page and usually contains the author, copyright, contact, sitemap, and navigation.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>

        <ul>
          
          <li>There are 3 ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheets, and external CSS style sheet</li>

          <li>Inline CSS apply to a specific HTML tag. They're useful for quick and permanent changes but are less flexible than external & internal style sheets</li>

          <li>Internal CSS style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file. The rules only apply to that page, and you can configure CSS classes and IDs, which are used to identify elements, to style multiple elements in the page code.</li>

          <li>External CSS syle sheets are the most preffered and most common because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier</li>

          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element</li>

          <li>A padding indicated how much space we want around the content inside an element</li>

          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property</li>

          <li>Text-align is one way to center a title or heading on a webpage</li>

          <li>The img selector assigns property values to any image element in the markup</li>

          <li>The display property is assigned with the block value, which assigns each image to start on a new line</li>

          <li>Just because files are in the same project repository doesn't mean they know about each other.  To do this, use the HTML link element.</li>

          <li>A link element creates the connections to the external file</li>

          <li> The href attribure specifies the location (URL) of the external resource</li>

          <li>Class Attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector</li>

        <h2>Git</h2>

        <ul>

          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>

          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new brnach and switches to it</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>

        <ul>

          <li>JavaScript is a high-level dynamic programming language hat allows users to interact with websites</li>

          <li>JavaScript is read from top to bottom, and order counts (Control flow)</li>

          <li>Variables are containers that store values</li>

          <li>Semicolons at the end of a line indicates where a statement ends</li>

          <li>JavaScript is case sensative</li>

          <li>Variable Type: (String) is a sequence of text.  Enclose it in single quote marks</li>

          <li>Variable Type: (Number). No quotes around them</li>

          <li>Variable Type: (Boolean) is a true/false value.  No quotes around them</li>

          <li>Variable Type: (Array) is a structure that allows you to store multiple values in a single reference</li>

          <li>Variable Type: (Object) can be anything and can be stored as a variable</li>

          <li>Why variables?  Necessary to do anything interesting and dynamic.  Think personalize messaged or change displays</li>

          <li>Comments are snippets of text that can be added along with code</li>

          <li>Operators are mathematical symbols that produces a result based on two values</li>

          <li>Operator Type: (Addition) adds two numbers together or combines two strings. Symbol (+)</li>

          <li>Operator Type: (Subtraction, Multiplication, Division) do exactly what they do in math. Symbols (-, *, /)</li>

          <li>Operator Type: (Assignment) assigns a value to a variable. Symbol (=)</li>

          <li>Operator Type: (Strcit equality) performs a test to see if two values are equal. It returns a true/false (Boolean) result. Symbol (===)</li>

          <li>Operator Type: (Not, Does-not-equal) returns the logically opposite value of what it precedes. Example, turns true into a false.  When used alongside the Equality operator, the negations operator tests whether the two values are "not" equal. Symbols (!, !==)</li>

          <li>Conditionals are code structures used to test if any expression returns true or not.  (if/else) statements</li>

          <li>Functions are a way of packaging functionality that you wish to reuse.  Good alternative to repeatedly writing the same code</li>

          <li>Events are code structures that listen for activity in the browser, and run code in response</li>

          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data</li>

          <li>A function is a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task</li>

          <li>A function's name is followed by parentheses ( ).</li>
